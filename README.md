# Banking System OOP Project
The project simulates some basic banking functionalities.

There are three type of roles in the app:
- Clients: can open, close and transfer bank accounts, check balance, redeem cheques
- Bankers: can approve, disapprove, validate tasks sent by customers
- Third-party employees: can send cheques with sum and codes to clients

Bankers work with three types of tasks:
- Open Account: sent by a user who wants to open a bank account
- Close Account: sent by a user who wants to close a bank account
- Change Bank: sent by a user who wants to move an account from one bank to another. Before being approved, the current bank must validate that such account exists.

Implemented Functionalites:
- signup
- login [egn] [password]
- create_bank
